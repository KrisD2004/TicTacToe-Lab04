## Summary

The TicTacToe Game Module is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows two players to compete against each other by taking turns marking spaces on a 3x3 game board. The module provides an interactive and engaging way to play the game, allowing players to strategize and compete for victory.

## Usage

1. To use the TicTacToe Game Module, follow these steps:

2. Start the program by running the application.

3. The program will display a greeting message and prompt you to enter the name of Player 1. Enter the name and press Enter.

4. Next, enter the name of Player 2 when prompted.

5. The program will display the names of the players and initialize the game board.

6. The current state of the board will be displayed, indicating the available slots.
